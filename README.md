This work is part of a postdoctoral project from the S찾o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP - Grants 2021/11306-0 and 2022/12785-1), carried out by Vitor M. de Oliveira at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of S찾o Paulo (Brazil) and the Centre for Physics of the University of Coimbra (Portugal), under the supervision of Prof. Clodoaldo Ragazzo (IME/USP) and with the collaboration of Prof. Alexandre Correia (CFisUC).

## Important notes

### Description

This program simulates the tidal evolution of celestial bodies interacting gravitationally with each other. The rheological model adopted here is based on the generalised Voigt viscoelastic model, which can be reduced to the Maxwell viscoelastic model. The equations of motion are numerically integrated using a Prince-Dormand Runge-Kutta scheme of 7th and 8th order with adaptive stepsize from the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). It was developed in Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS and tested in Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS and Fedora 41.

### Theory

The tidal theory used here deals with the celestial bodies' deformation in the time domain. For more information, please check the following article:

## Building from source

### Install dependencies

Building the program requires a c compiler, make, and the Gnu Scientific Library version 2.7. Running the plot feature of the program requires Gnuplot. 

In Ubuntu, the user may use the following command to install all necessary dependencies

```bash
apt install build-essential libgsl27 libgsl-dev gnuplot
```

And in Fedora

```bash
dnf install make gcc gsl gsl-devel gnuplot
```

### Compile

To compile the code and produce the executable ``rheo``, use

```bash
make
```

## Running the software

### User inputs

The user needs to provide the program with a ``configuration_file.dat``, which should specify the simulation name, the location of the input files, the location for the output files, and the name of the input files containing system and integration specifications. This information should be provided in a specific format (see examples folder and files therein).

The number of bodies to be considered from the system specs file can also be given in the configuration file. If this value is not passed to the program, the total number of bodies in the system specs file is assumed.

-->

### Run

To run the program, the configuration file should be passed along in the following manner:

```bash
./rheo configuration_file.dat
```

### Output

A folder named ``output_name`` containing the simulation data is created at the location provided by the user in the configuration file. This data contains the time evolution of each of the bodies' dynamical variables.

### Additional features

After running the program and obtaining the dynamical variables' time evolution, it is possible to calculate the orbital elements of every celestial body using

```bash
./rheo configuration_file.dat orbit
```

And also to calculate the spin variables of every celestial body using

```bash
./rheo configuration_file.dat spin
```

All this information is stored in the output folder.

Finally, using the previous data, it is possible to plot the time evolution of the main variables in the system via

```bash
./rheo configuration_file.dat plot
```

The plot command uses the software ``Gnuplot`` and it stores the output in a subfolder named ``figures``.

### Using make

For convenience, the aforementioned commands are already implemented in the Makefile, and they can be used in the following manner

```bash
make run INPUT=configuration_file.dat
make spin INPUT=configuration_file.dat
make plot INPUT=configuration_file.dat
```

If the user wants to run the code and calculate all of the additional features with one command, it can be done by typing

```bash
make all INPUT=configuration_file.dat
```

## Examples

This project contains six examples, whose configuration files can be found in the ``examples`` folder. These examples should work as a guide for using the code and also serve as a benchmark to check if the program is working properly on the user's computer.

### Example 1 - Earth-Moon-Sun system (examples/Example_1_EMS.dat)

This example simulates the dynamics of a system containing the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, all of which are treated as point masses. The main feature to be observed here is the lunar precession period of 18 months, which can be seen in the "I (째) vs Time (yr)" plot, where "I" is the lunar orbital inclination. See "examples/output_Example_1_EMS/figures/figure_Example_1_EMS_Moon_inclination.png".

### Example 2 - Isolated rigid Earth (examples/Example_2_E_rigid.dat)

This example simulates the dynamics of a rigid Earth with no external perturbations. The main dynamical feature to be seen here is Earth's nutation period, which would amount to 10 months if Earth was a rigid ellipsoid. Such value can be seen in the "Azimuthal angle (째) vs Time (yr)" plot. See "examples/output_Example_2_E_rigid/figures/figure_Example_2_E_rigid_Earth_azimuthal_angle.png".

</p>

### Example 3 - Isolated deformable Earth with Maxwell rheology (examples/Example_3_E_deformable.dat)

This example simulates the same system as before but with Earth now a deformable body. In this case, Earth's nutation period such be approximately 433 days. See "examples/output_Example_3_E_deformable/figures/figure_Example_3_E_deformable_Earth_azimuthal_angle.png".

</p>

The enlargement of Earth's nutation period due to its elastic properties is called *Chandler Wobble*. Such an effect was used to calibrate Earth in this example.

### Example 4 - Earth-Moon system with Maxwell rheology (examples/Example_4_EM.dat)

This example simulates the dynamics of a system containing the Earth and the Moon, where the Earth is a deformable extended body rotating with no obliquity, and the Moon is a point mass orbiting the Earth in a Keplerian orbit with zero eccentricity. The feature of interest here is the increase in the distance between the Earth and the Moon at a rate of about 3.8 cm/yr. Such effect was used to calibrate Earth's rheology in this situation and it can be observed in the "a (AU) vs Time (yr)" plot, where "a" is the orbit's semi-major axis. See "examples/output_Example_4_EM/figures/figure_Example_4_EM_Maxwell_Moon_semi_major_axis.png".

### Example 5 - Earth-Moon system with Burgers rheology - Chandler Wobble (examples/Example_5_EM_Burgers_Chandler_Wobble.dat)

This and the next examples simulate the Earth-Moon system, with the Earth as a deformable body and the Moon as a point-mass, but using a more complex rheological model for the Earth called the Burgers model. Here, both Chandler Wobble and lunar drift were used to calibrate Earth's rheology. This example is run using the same integration specifications as those of Example 3. We may observe here the Chandler Wobble. See "examples/output_Example_5_EM_Burgers_Chandler_Wobble/figures/figure_Example_5_EM_Burgers_Chandler_Wobble_Earth_azimuthal_angle.png".

### Example 6 - Earth-Moon system with Burgers rheology - Moon's orbital drift (examples/Example_6_EM_Burgers_Moon_orbital_drift.dat)

This example is run using the same integration specifications as those of Example 4. We may observe here the lunar orbital drift. See "examples/output_Example_6_EM_Burgers_Moon_orbital_drift/figures/figure_Example_6_EM_Burgers_Moon_orbital_drift_Moon_semi_major_axis.png"
